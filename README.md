# ArtificialIntelligence
Some simple projects that show how to apply simple AI concepts in real world use cases

# What's this repo?
This repository contains 4 examples of Artificial Intelligence concepts and algorithms applied to real world use-cases. 

The 1st project contains algorithms used for traversing and searching a node in a graph. In particular, BFS (Breadth-First-Search), DFS (Depth-First-Search), A\* and IDA (Iterative-Deepening-Algorithm) were implemented.

The 2nd project contains the implementation of Min-Max algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning applied to the 2048 game. In this project is also provided a simple heuristic to make the algorithm decide which move should it make in order to reach the 2048.

The 3rd project contains a simple implementation of the Perceptron, the Gradient-Descend. Then a few classification examples are listed using Classificator from the sklearn package.

The 4th project shows how to use Forward-Checking (for Arc-Consinstency) and Backtracking in order to solve Sudokus.

Finally, the 5th project shows an example of Sentiment Analysis using a Stochastic Gradient Descend classifier trained on descriptions of movies.
